# Next.js Server Components Rules

1. ALWAYS use server components for data fetching in Next.js applications
2. NEVER use client-side state management when URL parameters can be used instead
3. ALWAYS fetch data on the server side using async/await in server components
4. NEVER use useEffect or useState for data fetching
5. ALWAYS make components async when they need to fetch data
6. ALWAYS use proper typing for component props and data structures
7. ALWAYS handle loading and error states appropriately
8. ALWAYS use proper error boundaries for server components
9. ALWAYS use proper caching strategies for server components
10. ALWAYS use proper revalidation strategies for server components
